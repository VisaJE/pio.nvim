# Simple platformio wrappers for neovim
**Made for personal tweaking**
This plugin sets some convenient mappings if a project is detected as platformio project.
At this point the autoload functions have to be modified for configuration.
## Setup
* Depends on dbakker/vim-projectroot
1. Install via whatever. 
2. Call pio#InitPlatformioProject(root) with "root" pointing to the folder with platformio.ini
